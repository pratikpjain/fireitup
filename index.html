                <h1>Play with C</h1>
                <p>C is a general purpose programming language with a long history. C is used for many different types
                    of
                    software, but it is particularly popular for system software, such as operating systems, device
                    drivers
                    and telecommunications applications. C is widely used because it runs very fast. It can also access
                    a
                    computer system's low level functions; this means it is closer to the hardware than some other
                    programming languages. C has become an official standard of the American National Standards
                    Institute,
                    or ANSI. Many other programming languages borrow syntax from C.</p>

                <h1>Play with C++</h1>
                <p>C++ is a high-level programming language that builds on its predecessor C by adding object-oriented
                    features to it. C++ is very versatile and can be used for many different applications. C++ is also
                    an
                    official ANSI standard. C++ is used widely for applications that rely more heavily on a graphical
                    user
                    interface, or GUI. For example, many utility programs and device drivers are written in C, while
                    applications software with many user dialogs are written in C++. The name C++ represents the
                    evolution
                    of the C language because the two plus symbols represent the increment operator in C.

                <h1>Play with Python</h1>
                <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
                    Its
                    high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very
                    attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to
                    connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability
                    and
                    therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which
                    encourages program modularity and code reuse.

                <h1>Play with Java</h1>
                <p>Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. It was originally designed
                    for
                    developing programs for set-top boxes and handheld devices, but later became a popular choice for
                    creating web applications.The Java syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly an object-oriented
                    programming language. For example, most Java programs contain classes, which are used to define
                    objects,
                    and methods, which are assigned to individual classes. Java is also known for being more strict than
                    C++, meaning variables and functions must be explicitly defined.
